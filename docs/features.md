### A user interface

We have pygame framework on our user interface!

### Exercises

We have a few exercises, namely the below.

#### Pushup

#### Crunches

#### Squats

### Highscore

It displays the current highscore ever right below the rep counter.

### Rep counter

This feature displays the amount of reps (times) you've done said exercise.

### Fps Counter

This features shows the current fps of the webcam!
> This is a neat qol, that's all

### Angle counter

This feature shows the angle of the your skeletal structure at crucial points.  
For example, pushup is the bicep pushing you up; thus showing a circle angle at the joint near the bicecp.

### Executable to run

This feature is another QOL;
It's here so that you don't need ANY setup, any python, any requirement!  
Just install the OS-specific executable for you, be it Dos(Windows), Darwin(MacOS), Posix/Unix (Some linux distro/mac)  
Links will be added here to the specific downloads later!

### Timer

We have a timer to time the total time taken in the current exercise!

Have fun working out!
